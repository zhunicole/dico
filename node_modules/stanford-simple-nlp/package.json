Stanford CoreNLP is an integrated framework, which make it very easy to apply a bunch of language analysis tools to a piece of text. Starting from plain text, you can run all the tools on it with just two lines of code. Its analyses provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level and domain-specific text understanding applications.\n\nStanford CoreNLP integrates all our NLP tools, including the part-of-speech (POS) tagger, the named entity recognizer (NER), the parser, and the coreference resolution system, and provides model files for analysis of English. The goal of this project is to enable people to quickly and painlessly get complete linguistic annotations of natural language texts. It is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option you can change which tools should be enabled and which should be disabled.\n\nThe Stanford CoreNLP code is written in Java and licensed under the GNU General Public License (v2 or later). Source is included. Note that this is the full GPL, which allows many free uses, but not its use in distributed proprietary software. The download is 214 MB and requires Java 1.6+.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nnode-stanford-simple-nlp depends on [Standord CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) v1.3.2 or higher. Don't forget to set JAVA variable referred to [node-java](https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-java).\n\n    $ npm install stanford-simple-nlp\n\n**Important!** You should download `stanford-corenlp-full-2013-11-12.zip` file and unzip to `jar/` folder. You can download the file from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2013-11-12.zip). This file couldn't be pushed to github & npm because of its too big size(about 211MB).\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initialize\n```javascript\nvar StanfordSimpleNLP = require('stanford-simple-nlp').StanfordSimpleNLP;\n```\n\n#### with options\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n  annotators: ['tokenize', 'ssplit', 'pos', 'lemma', 'ner', 'parse' 'dcoref']\n};\n\nvar stanfordSimpleNLP = new StanfordSimpleNLP(options, function(err) {\n  stanfordSimpleNLP.process('This is so good.', function(err, result) {\n    ...\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### without options\n```javascript\nvar stanfordSimpleNLP = new StanfordSimpleNLP( function(err) {\n  stanfordSimpleNLP.process('This is so good.', function(err, result) {\n    ...\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Warning!** If you didn't initialize the class without callback function then you will meet `'Load a pipeline first.'` error. So you have to do it with callback function or call `loadPipeline(options, callback)` function seperately.\n\n\n## License\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
